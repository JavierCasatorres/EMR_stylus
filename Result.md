### V2 initial version
It was very difficult to tune the circuit: once tuned when connected with the
coil via long cables, the parasitic capacitance threw the circuit off frequency.
Multiple iterations were required.

### V2 final version
I ended up using some handy DIP adapters to simply plug the capacitors as I was
tuning the circuit.

The final result, once mounted, was actually good, but the pen was not very usable.
For some reason, I have finally ended tuning better the V1 prototype than this
"improved" version.
